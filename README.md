# Smart & Adaptive Street Light System Using CNN
🚦 A smart, CNN-powered street lighting system that dynamically adjusts brightness, detects motion, monitors safety, and sends emergency alerts — all while saving energy and making streets safer.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the use of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and sensors to build an **AI-powered street light system**. It includes:

- Motion-based lighting adjustments
- Panic button emergency alerts
- Camera-based object detection
- Automatic email notification system

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **Flask**
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**
- Google Colab (for training)
